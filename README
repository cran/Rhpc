   * Cheaty usage:D
     We have upgraded the package Rhpc, especially for Windows OS. In the
     former Windows MPI version, batch process using mpiexec was required
     for execusion. Recently, MS-MPI supports MPI_Comm_Spawn.
     However, we still need to execute master process by mpiexec.
     So we make a program fakemaster which enables to execute mpiexec
     in the background and extract environments in MPI and pass them
     to original R process, then it performs MPI_Init.
     This is very tricky but it works, and make it possible to execute
     MPI from RGui and Rstudio.
     Caution that mpiexec and fakemaster start command line console
     windows, which should not be stopped during execution.
     If you hope to perform MPI on several machines, msmpilauchsvc is
     required, but we did not test it sufficiently.
     Arguments of mpiexec can be specified such as
          options(Rhpc.mpiexec="mpiexec -n 1")
     and it adds fakemaster at the end of mpiexec command like
          "mpiexec -n 1 fakemaster"
     when Rhpc_initialize.
     There seems to be no way to activate processes of other nodes
     at MPI_Comm_spawn on MS-MPI v9.01.
     (only single node MPI-Comm-spawn on MS-MPI v 9.01)

     ex. launch Rgui,Rstudio or Rterm
     follow input
     > library(Rhpc)
     > Rhpc_initialize()
     > cl<-Rhpc_getHandle(3)
     > Rhpc_worker_call(cl,Sys.getpid)
     > Rhpc_finalize()
     > q("no")


    * Traditional usage (Really hard to use...)

     Installed in the package top directory, please look and use the Rhpc*.cmd shell.
     R_home reference from registry.

     ex. launch Rgui(x64)
       Click %USERPROFILE%\Documents\R\win-binary\3.2\Rhpc\RhpcWin64.cmd
     follow input 
     > library(Rhpc)
     > Rhpc_initialize()
     > cl<-Rhpc_getHandle()
     > Rhpc_worker_call(cl,Sys.getpid)
     > Rhpc_finalize()
     > q("no")
     
     ex. launch batch(x64)
     C:> %USERPROFILE%\Documents\R\win-binary\3.2\Rhpc\Rhpc64.cmd BATCH test.R
